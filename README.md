# image-segmentation-UNet

Here, image segmentation is done on the DAGM dataset using variations of the UNet architecture.
Changes in performance and results are observed upon changing the hyper-parameters and tweaking the model architechture.
Similar machine learning algorithms can be used for defect inspection on metallic surfaces.
